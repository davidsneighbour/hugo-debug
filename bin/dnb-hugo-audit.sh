# ZgotmplZ
# ZgotmplZ is a special value that indicates that unsafe content reached

# HAHAHUGO
# Under conditions too complex to explain in this article, a rendered
# shortcode may include all or a portion of the string HAHAHUGOSHORTCODE
# in either uppercase or lowercase. This is difficult to detect in all
# cicumstances because, depending on a variety of factors, the rendered
# shortcode may include H, HA, HAH, HAHA, HAHAH, HAHAHU, HAHAHUG,
# HAHAHUGO, etc. A case-insensitive search of the output for HAHAHUGO is
# likely to catch the majority of cases without producing false positives.
#
# [i18n]
# This is the placeholder produced instead of the default value or an
# empty string if a translation is missing.
